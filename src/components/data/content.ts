  intro: "Hi, I’m Tsholofelo Ndawonde — a software engineer.",
  story: "This website serves as a platform where I document my learning process, share project insights, and reflect on my growth as a software engineer in the real world. My goal is to help others by sharing clear and practical lessons from my own journey.",
  approach: `My journey into software development started with a simple curiosity about how websites work. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a habit of building, experimenting, breaking things, and learning through hands-on experience. What began as exploration gradually became a craft and eventually, a career. In my professional work, I primarily use C# and the .NET ecosystem, which has significantly influenced my approach to software design, performance, and maintainability. I’m a big fan of the ecosystem and the discipline it encourages around building reliable, long-lived systems. Alongside that foundation, I’ve been intentionally expanding my expertise into the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly Node.js and TypeScript. Learning across stacks has helped me see familiar problems from new angles and build more flexible, end-to-end solutions from APIs and backend systems to modern web interfaces. I care deeply about clean code, thoughtful architecture, and creating software that is both scalable and user-friendly. I’m especially interested in how systems evolve over time and how small design decisions compound as applications grow. I believe learning is most powerful when it’s shared. Writing helps me think clearly, and building projects helps me test ideas in the real world. Every post and project here represents something I’ve learned, whether it worked perfectly or failed in an interesting way. If you’re learning, building, or figuring things out as you go, you’re in the right place.`
